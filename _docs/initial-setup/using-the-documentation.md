Welcome to the dRonin documentation.  It's one of many resources that can assist you in configuring a dRonin flight controller.  The [Getting Started with dRonin](doc:getting-started) page might be a good place to start.  Otherwise, on the left of this page a variety of topics are linked.

**Please ensure you are reading the proper version of the documentation.  At the top of this page is a pull-down menu where you can select any recent release or the current development branch.**

##Any resources besides these docs that may be helpful?

You betcha.

Note that in the dRonin Ground Control Station software it is possible to hover the mouse over a UI control to get a floating tool-tip that often provides very useful information on how to use the GCS.

The [dRonin wiki](https://github.com/d-ronin/dRonin/wiki) covers many topics that are not fully explained in this documentation.  We also have a [forum](https://forum.dronin.org) that may be helpful if you're stuck.

If you believe you've encountered a bug, you can search and/or add to the [issue database at GitHub](https://github.com/d-ronin/dRonin/issues).
