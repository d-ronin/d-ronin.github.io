Welcome to the dRonin documentation.  It's one of many resources that can assist you in configuring a dRonin flight controller.  

{% include callout type="danger_full" title="dRonin is provided without any warranty!" text="Multirotors and remote controlled aircraft are potentially dangerous.  Ensure you are flying in a safe environment and **FLY AT YOUR OWN RISK**." %}

The [Getting Started with dRonin](/docs/initial-setup/getting-started/) page might be a good place to start.  Otherwise, on the left side of this page a variety of topics are linked.  Besides this documentation, the [dRonin wiki](https://github.com/d-ronin/dRonin/wiki) covers many topics that are not fully explained in this documentation.  We also have a [forum](https://forum.dronin.org) that may be helpful if you're stuck.

## Are there any other resources that may be helpful?

If you believe you've encountered a bug, you can search and/or add to the [issue database at GitHub](https://github.com/d-ronin/dRonin/issues).

Note that in the dRonin Ground Control Station software it is possible to hover the mouse over a UI control to get a floating tool-tip that often provides very useful information on how to use the GCS.
